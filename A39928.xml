            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Dearely beloved friends, my <hi>Brethren and Sisters in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> when the bleſſed God inclined my heart to the worke of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> my earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to God was, that he would be pleaſed to eaſt my lot in a place where I might be (if he ſaw good) eminently uſefull in the Church and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt: and in order thereunto, that he would be pleaſed to take off my heart from aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at great things, in the world: that I might never be carryed away with them, ſo as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the worke of the Lord, in any meaſure; and that God would give me an enlarged heart and ſufficient abilitys to performe ſo <hi>great a worke,</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and faithfully all my days: but it pleaſed God to hold me in ſuſpence many months after I began to preach; ſometimes gathering that God would have me fit down in one place, ſometimes in another: but I could not be fully ſatisfyed where the Lord would have me to abide.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I determined to ſtay longer in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of Oxford,</hi> and to wayt for a ſatisfactory anſwer from God. The ſame week that I thus reſolved, I was deſired to preach the next Lords day, at <hi>Chippin-Norton,</hi> which accordingly I did; and it pleaſed God to begin to put a <hi>ſeale to my Miniſtry</hi> there as he had done in other places before: and being importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with much earneſtneſſe to preach to you once more I was willing ſo to do: Afterward you earneſtly with the reſt of the Inhabitants, deſired me to accept of the place and be your Miniſter. At that time I had three places offered me; one of them was worth neer twenty times as much as this poor Vicari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ge that now I have; (as many can teſtify) but I found my heart more inclined towards you then towards any of the ſaid places and through Grace I refuſed all of them for your ſakes; and after I had ſpent many days in asking counſell of God, I was perſwaded, and in ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63770:3"/>meaſure ſatisfyed that the Lord would have me abide with you, at leaſt for a time.</p>
            <p>And accordingly I found the Lord ſweetly and ſtrongly bearing in my former reſolutions and promiſes to God when I was depending upon him for directing and ſtrengthning Grace upon my heart, and the Lord was pleaſed to ſatisfy your deſires by his engaging of my heart to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with you, and I aſſure you that I am willing to ſpend, and to be ſpent for you, and as I never thought any paines too great nor any difficulty too hard that I have not endeavoured to take and break thorow, for the weale and happineſſe of your ſoules: ſo I truſt I ſhall never knowingly neglect any oportunity, wher in I may any way further your wellbeing here and your eternall Salvation hereafter.</p>

               </gap>, for all my temporall loſſes, for my care and paines, labour and travel for your everlaſting happineſſe are, that you will be pleaſed to read, conſider, and practice theſe following dutys.</p>
            <p>I intreat you all for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, for the love you beare to his <hi>name,</hi> his <hi>honour,</hi> for the love you have to <hi>your own ſoules:</hi> if you love <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and deſire <hi>communion with the ever bleſſed God:</hi> if you would have the <hi>ſweet ſmiles of your heavenly Father</hi> breaking forth upon you: for the love you profeſſe to have to the <hi>glorious Goſpell</hi> and <hi>Appointments of Chriſt:</hi> for the reſpect you have to the <hi>Lords people,</hi> who love you and pray for you, who prayed for you before you could pray for your ſelves, who have ſeen your converſion, rejoyced with you, for the Grace of God in you as <hi>Barnabas for the Saints at Antioch</hi> (11. Act.) for the love you beare to me: if you deſire to lay up to your ſelves <hi>a good foundation againſt the time to come,</hi> to have continuall aſſurance of the Love of God towards you, if you would not be ſtumbling blocks to ſinners: if you value the <hi>pretious blood of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> if you deſire to be prepared for death, and to be partakers of that <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> which is laid up in Heaven for the heires of Heaven, ſuch as by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for it. Rom. 2.7.</p>
            <p>(I do beſeech you in the firſt place,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Try and examine your ſelves whether God hath throughly and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly convinced you of your <hi>miſerable and loſt eſtate and condition by nature,</hi> Joh. 16.8. which may be known by theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hath God by his Word and Spirit broken and melted your hearts; hath it been and is it ſo ſtill a ſoule emptying and heart breathing conviction? hath the Lord ſhewn you your own nothingneſſe and inſufficiency; that you have nothing in you that is able in whole, or in part to deliver you out of your ſad eſtate: that you are <hi>poore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63770:3"/>and miſerable, and blind, and naked.</hi> Rev. 3.17. <hi>without Chriſts Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Have your convictions been ſelfe loathing, and ſelfe abhorring convictions Ezek. 36.31. Job. 42.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Have you been convinced of the evill of ſinne in generall and of your ſinnes in particular, both of <hi>emiſſion</hi> and <hi>commiſſion,</hi> how the great, the gracious, and mercifull God hath been diſhonoured by you, he who waited to be gracious unto you ſo many yeares who invited and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to come in and be reconciled to him by Jeſus Chriſt? 2 Jer. 19. Rom. 7.13. hath it been the burden of your ſoules that you ſhould thus requite the Lord, to chooſe rather to ſerve ſinne and Sathan then to ſerve him? Jerem. 3 25. 1 Tim. 1.13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Are you brought to loath, to hate, and abhorre all your ſinnes: your <hi>right hand,</hi> and <hi>right eye ſinnes:</hi> your former <hi>beloved ſinnes,</hi> that were eſpouſed to you? doe you loath the very garment ſpotted with the fleſh? Pſal. 119.104, 113. Rom. 7.15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Have you caſt off &amp; taken your leave of all your <hi>former evill ways;</hi> your fleſh pleaſing and profitable ſinnes as you accounted them: can you ſay that your hearts are brought to this, that you had rather <hi>ſuffer much,</hi> then <hi>ſinne a little:</hi> that you had rather die then hugge, entertaine, or commit any known ſinne? Ezek. 36.25. Judg. 10.16. Hoſ. 14.8. 1 Joh. 3.9.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="8">8. Have you underſtood &amp; ſeriouſly conſidered what it will coſt you to be Chriſtians indeed? many (as I have often told you) when they are a little ſtartled and awaked by the terrors of the Almighty; make ſome fooliſh, deſperate reſolutions and attempts to change their courſe of life; and go on ſo to doe for a while; but when they meet with ſtormes and tempeſts they change their minds and go back with the dogge to their vomit 2 Pet. 2.22.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63770:4"/>ſuffer or undergoe, ſo that you may <hi>winne Christ and be found in him,</hi> Phil. 3.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Hath God followed theſe convictions? have they been revived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine when they have been dying or ſleeping? have they ſpurr'd you on to Chriſt and to a more dilligent and earneſt enquiry after God and your ſelves Phil. 1.6. Phil. 2.13. Joh. 16.9.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Did ſinne lye ſo heavy upon your Conſciences and the ſence of Divine wrath, as to make you reſtleſſely and unweariedly to make out after Jeſus Chriſt for reſt and peace? Math. 11.28.29. and when you went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to quiet your Conſciences with your prayers, or the good opinion of the Saints: or your reformation or reſting upon any other broken reeds or ſparkes of your own kindling. Did the bleſſed God fetch you off, and continually purſue your Conſciences untill he had brought your wills to chooſe and accept of Jeſus Chriſt upon his own termes; and that freely without looking back with reluctancy of Spirit &amp;c. finding a kind of loathneſſe and unwillingneſſe to foregoe your Idols; but you could cherefully and heartily caſt them all away? can you remember that the Lord hath brought you ſo farre, and is ſtill carrying on the worke in your hearts: can you find that your hearts were and ſtill are drawn to go to the free grace and mercy of God in and by Ieſus Chriſt, by his blood and righteouſneſſe, and in the ſight and ſenſe of your own loſt, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and woefull eſtate and condition being ſinners, and in the ſenſe of your own vileneſſe, ſinfullneſſe, unworthineſſe; &amp; inſufficiency ſay ſincerly &amp; heartily; Oh Lord: here is a poor, wretched, ſinfull Creature come to thee for to be juſtifyed and pardoned: Oh Lord I doe abhorre my ſelfe and all my own Righteouſneſſe: I am a poor begger, miſerable, blind, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: Oh Lord I am a condemned perſon caſt and loſt and I am like to periſh for ever by thy righteous Law: but Oh I heare that there is another Court of Iuſtice and mercy erected for poor ſinners to appeale unto, and I am invited, nay commanded to make my appeale there: Lord I come unto thy free grace and mercy: nay Lord I come to thy Juſtice in Ghriſts name 1 Joh. 1.9.

I preſerre thy ways and thy Commandements tenthouſand times before my old ways. Oh Lord I have delighted in ſinne but now in Holineſſe; to pleaſe my luſts, but now to pleaſe my God. Oh Lord I am willing to have an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt upon any termes, ſend me where thou wilt, do with me as it ſhall ſeem good unto thee; only deny me not an intereſt in thy Son, in thy ſpeciall Love Oh for Chriſt, for Chriſt am I come; give me Chriſt elſe I dye; I will hang upon thy invitation, thy <hi>command,</hi> thy <hi>promiſe,</hi> Joh. 7.37. 1 John 3.23. Joh. 6.37. Oh Lord thou haſt invited ſinners to come in, and be reconciled unto thee; O Lord thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and beſeeched ſinners; 2 Cor. 5.20. to accept of the termes of reconciliation. Oh Lord I doe come, I am a ſinner; I am one of them that is invited; 'tis true I am a great ſinner, oh yet I am but a ſinner. Oh I am willing now to be ſaved in the ſame way that <hi>Paul</hi> was. Oh Lord why not I? why not I? ſeeeing that ſinners are invited, yea whoever will let him come. O Lord thou haſt commanded ſinners ſuch as ſee themſelves loſt, to look upon thy mercy and Grace in Chriſt and be Saved Iſ. 45.22. Oh Lord I come in Obedience to thy command, I am reſolved to hang here: Yea Lord thou haſt promiſed <hi>never to caſt off ſuch as come unto thee;</hi> Oh Lord I'll hang upon thy faithfullneſſe and promiſe: Oh let me find favour I am reſolved to take no denyall; I will not be put off without thee <hi>Lord Jeſus;</hi> I am reſolved to be like the importunate Widdow Luk. 18.1, 2, 3, 4. I will keep crying and praying; Oh Lord 'tis for my life; Oh Lord thou haſt been a long time waiting to be gracious unto me, now I will wait for thee to anſwer my petition, thou haſt been many yeares wooing of me to gaine my Love, and conſent to marry thy Sonne: Oh Lord now I'll woe thee; Oh now I conſent freely. Now with all my heart I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to contract with him; here is my ſoule and body and all is ready for him; Oh if I might but hear one comfortable word from thee about it: Oh that I might ſee but one ſmile; but one good look, to encomage me to continue my ſuit, Oh Lord the end of my coming to thee is, that I may be made <hi>holy,</hi> as well as <hi>happy;</hi> to be <hi>ſaved from ſinne,</hi> as well as <hi>from wrath:</hi> Oh Lord if thou ſhouldeſt reject me, I ſhall diſhonour thee to all eternity, the thoughts whereof is burthen ſome to mee: if thou ſhalt pleaſe to accept me, and <hi>adopt</hi> me into <hi>that family,</hi> and <hi>ingraft me into Chriſt,</hi> I ſhall live to thy honour and glory: Oh Lord when bloody perſecuting <hi>Paul</hi> ſought for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for acceptance, when <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> and other great ſinners, came
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63770:5"/>to thee for pardon thou didſt accept them.

Hath the Lord dealt thus with you, have you been thus brought to Chriſt; could you never be quiet, and ſatisfyed untill you had <hi>peace</hi> ſpoken to you by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in anſwer to your conſtant and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſuits and petitions; oh then be of good comfort Chriſt is thine; the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God is in thee; thou haſt an intereſt in the <hi>ſpeciall Love of God,</hi> and in the <hi>Govenant of Grace;</hi> thou mayſt go on tryumphing over <hi>ſinne, death. and hell</hi> who ſhall lay any thing to your charge, Rom. 8. Chriſt is at the right hand of the Father for you.</p>
            <p>Oh but beloved your worke is not yet at an end; you may not think that it is enough that you are in Chriſt, and Chriſt in you, that now you may fit ſtill and be idle; no you juſt now beginne to worke, you never ſerved Chriſt till he brought you home unto himſelfe; Oh then now up and be doing and the Lord will be with you.</p>
            <p>My beloved the reaſon why I have given theſe few <hi>trialls,</hi> and deſired you to <hi>try your estates</hi> by them, is, that you may go on in the practice of your duty to God and man, the more freely, quietly and Comfortably: for I am very ſenſible what advantage the Devill hath upon poor Believers in their Chriſtian walking, when they are always upon every temptation, ready to doubt whether they are in Chriſt, when they ſhould go about their maſters buſineſſe; the Divell would faine perſwade them that they are not his <hi>ſervants,</hi> and that they have no relation to him, his end is to render their lives <hi>uncomfortable and unfruitfull,</hi> but now when poor ſoules are ſure that they have thus been brought to Chriſt, as before, and reaſoning thus: well I can ſay that I have been thus drawn to Chriſt. I have choſen him upon his own termes, and he hath ſaid he will caſt off none that ſo come to him; well I will caſt my ſoule upon his word, il'e truſt him with my ſelfe; and all my concernements, ile care for nothing but how I may live and <hi>honour God,</hi> how I may bring forth <hi>fruite to him;</hi> I am commanded to caſt all my care on him 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. and to commit my ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in well doing; well I will goe about my Fathers worke and doe what he hath commanded me.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you minde this in the whole courſe of your lives; when you are tempted to neglect your worke and fall back to diſtruſtfull feares, and doubts about your eſtates; oh then ſtand up ſtoutly and be not overtaken with the tempters wiles; and you will find it very advantageous to your ſoules.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If upon due triall and ſearch you can find that you have been <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineed, emptyed,</hi> and <hi>humbled,</hi> and at laſt brought to Chriſt as you have

IF you deſire to walk with God: then labour much to be <hi>watchfull Chriſtians,</hi> keep a ſtrict eye upon your hearts; no Chriſtian like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>watchfull Chriſtian:</hi> none ſo holy, ſo humble, ſo ſtrong, ſo wiſe, and faithfull: <hi>watchfullneſse</hi> is a preſerving duty, and therefore the Holy Ghoſt is often preſſing it upon the Lords people: <hi>Math.</hi> 24.42. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.41. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.33. to the end. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Coll.</hi> 4.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 7.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Labour to ſpie out the very <hi>firſt turning away of your hearts from God,</hi> and then you may prevent your hearts from going any farther; when you are upon your watch, you will find quickly which way your hearts are enclining, and where they intend, and for what: if you do ſo conſtantly and faithfully, you will be able to keep your ground, and ſtill be Lords over your own hearts under God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Watch</hi> that you may ſee and quickly find out what ſecret flatteries, and fleſh pleaſing inſinuations the Divell at any time ſhall ſuggeſt unto you; Satan will draw you off from God if poſſible, not by violent temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but by ſome ſweet ſuggeſtions; pretending that you may do ſuch and ſuch things: for they are lawfull, and others have done ſuch things, that have been holy wiſe men: others have ſpent much time in <hi>ſeaſting,</hi> and <hi>merry meetings:</hi> in <hi>jeſtings,</hi> and <hi>merry diſcourſes:</hi> in <hi>ſleeping</hi> and <hi>idleneſſe:</hi> and why not you alſo: why theſe things are not altogether unlawfull, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch wayes he hath to ſeduce you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſure to keep a <hi>ſtrict watch</hi> when you are in <hi>vaine, evill company:</hi> for then you will be in great danger of being betrayed; your hearts will ſoon be drawn to cloſe with them; at leaſt to a conniving at them, or to ſpeak ſomething that may manifeſt too much of your conſenting to them: and make them the more bold in their practiſes, and betray your own hearts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Obſerve your hearts</hi> when providence calls you to <hi>change,</hi> either your

                  <hi>places</hi> or <hi>buſineſſes,</hi> or both: for then you will be in great danger of <hi>looſing your hearts,</hi> and your God too: many gracious hearts have found it true by ſad experience; that have kept cloſe to God for the moſt part, after they have been converted, ſo long as they have lived in the ſame places, and followed the ſame imployments; but in and after ſome conſiderable changes, they have miſerably fallen, and departed from God. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.</p>

When you meet with any <hi>great diſappointments,</hi> and <hi>croſſe providences;</hi> or God at any time gives you your <hi>hearts deſires;</hi> then be ſure to have a <hi>ſtrict eye over your hearts:</hi> for if you are not exceeding carefull at ſuch times, you will backſlide from God: for then your thoughts will be taken up, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout making ſome carnall advantag by the one: or in looking too much on the <hi>ſecond cauſes</hi> in the other: at ſuch times either your hearts will be too high or too low: <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.</p>

Be ſure to <hi>watch your hearts,</hi> when you are in <hi>holy duties;</hi> eſpecially when you <hi>pray,</hi> or <hi>ſpeak before others,</hi> or when you <hi>joyne with others in prayer,</hi> your hearts will be like the fooles eyes in every corner of the earth at ſuch a time; or pride, and ſelfe exalting will ariſe in your hearts: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the heart is very apt to grow ſecure and careleſſe <hi>then,</hi> more then at another time: then Satan and your own hearts will tell you, that now all is well, and therefore eat, drink, and be merry, untill you have

               <p n="4">4. Becauſe if you ſhould depart from God after ſuch <hi>ſweet expreſſions of his love,</hi> you will more diſhonour and grieve him then before, and God will take it as a very proud affront to his Majeſty, that when he hath ſweetly and gratiouſly anſwered your deſires, you ſhould ſo much ſlight and undervalue him, as not to endeavour to keep what he hath given you: 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe when you were waiting and depending on God, for ſuch or the like favours, as you have received, you promiſed and vowed that you would improve them when the Lord ſhould grant them, now you cannot poſſibly make good your promiſes and vowes, except you be very <hi>watchfull, Pſal.</hi> 76.11. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="6">6.
